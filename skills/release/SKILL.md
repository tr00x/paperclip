  Coordinate a full Paperclip release across engineering verification, npm,
  GitHub, website publishing, and announcement follow-up. Use when leadership
  asks to ship a release, not merely to discuss version bumps.

# Release Coordination Skill

Run the full Paperclip release as a maintainer workflow, not just an npm publish.

This skill coordinates:

- stable changelog drafting via `release-changelog`
- prerelease canary publishing via `scripts/release.sh --canary`
- Docker smoke testing via `scripts/docker-onboard-smoke.sh`
- stable publishing via `scripts/release.sh`
- pushing the release commit and tag
- GitHub Release creation via `scripts/create-github-release.sh`
- website / announcement follow-up tasks

## Trigger

Use this skill when leadership asks for:

- "do a release"
- "ship the next patch/minor/major"
- "release vX.Y.Z"

## Preconditions

Before proceeding, verify all of the following:

1. `skills/release-changelog/SKILL.md` exists and is usable.
2. The repo working tree is clean, including untracked files.
3. There are commits since the last stable tag.
4. The release SHA has passed the verification gate or is about to.
5. npm publish rights are available locally, or the GitHub release workflow is being used with trusted publishing.
6. If running through Paperclip, you have issue context for status updates and follow-up task creation.

If any precondition fails, stop and report the blocker.

## Inputs

Collect these inputs up front:

- requested bump: `patch`, `minor`, or `major`
- whether this run is a dry run or live release
- whether the release is being run locally or from GitHub Actions
- release issue / company context for website and announcement follow-up

## Step 0 — Release Model

Paperclip now uses this release model:

1. Draft the **stable** changelog as `releases/vX.Y.Z.md`
2. Publish one or more **prerelease canaries** such as `X.Y.Z-canary.0`
3. Smoke test the canary via Docker
4. Publish the stable version `X.Y.Z`
5. Push the release commit and tag
6. Create the GitHub Release
7. Complete website and announcement surfaces

Critical consequence:

- Canaries do **not** use promote-by-dist-tag anymore.
- The changelog remains stable-only. Do not create `releases/vX.Y.Z-canary.N.md`.

## Step 1 — Decide the Stable Version

Run release preflight first:

```bash
./scripts/release-preflight.sh canary {patch|minor|major}
# or
./scripts/release-preflight.sh stable {patch|minor|major}
```

Then use the last stable tag as the base:

```bash
LAST_TAG=$(git tag --list 'v*' --sort=-version:refname | head -1)
git log "${LAST_TAG}..HEAD" --oneline --no-merges
git diff --name-only "${LAST_TAG}..HEAD" -- packages/db/src/migrations/
git diff "${LAST_TAG}..HEAD" -- packages/db/src/schema/
git log "${LAST_TAG}..HEAD" --format="%s" | rg -n 'BREAKING CHANGE|BREAKING:|^[a-z]+!:' || true
```

Bump policy:

- destructive migrations, removed APIs, breaking config changes -> `major`
- additive migrations or clearly user-visible features -> at least `minor`
- fixes only -> `patch`

If the requested bump is too low, escalate it and explain why.

## Step 2 — Draft the Stable Changelog

Invoke `release-changelog` and generate:

- `releases/vX.Y.Z.md`

Rules:

- review the draft with a human before publish
- preserve manual edits if the file already exists
- keep the heading and filename stable-only, for example `v1.2.3`
- do not create a separate canary changelog file

## Step 3 — Verify the Release SHA

Run the standard gate:

```bash
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm test:run
pnpm build
```

If the release will be run through GitHub Actions, the workflow can rerun this gate. Still report whether the local tree currently passes.

## Step 4 — Publish a Canary

Run:

```bash
./scripts/release.sh {patch|minor|major} --canary --dry-run
./scripts/release.sh {patch|minor|major} --canary
```

What this means:

- npm receives `X.Y.Z-canary.N` under dist-tag `canary`
- `latest` remains unchanged
- no git tag is created
- the script cleans the working tree afterward

Guard:

- if the current stable is `0.2.7`, the next patch canary is `0.2.8-canary.0`
- the tooling must never publish `0.2.7-canary.N` after `0.2.7` is already stable

After publish, verify:

```bash
npm view paperclipai@canary version
```

The user install path is:

```bash
npx paperclipai@canary onboard
```

## Step 5 — Smoke Test the Canary

Run:

```bash
PAPERCLIPAI_VERSION=canary ./scripts/docker-onboard-smoke.sh
```

Confirm:

1. install succeeds
2. onboarding completes
3. server boots
4. UI loads
5. basic company/dashboard flow works

If smoke testing fails:

- stop the stable release
- fix the issue
- publish another canary
- repeat the smoke test

Each retry should create a higher canary ordinal, while the stable target version can stay the same.

## Step 6 — Publish Stable

Once the SHA is vetted, run:

```bash
./scripts/release.sh {patch|minor|major} --dry-run
./scripts/release.sh {patch|minor|major}
```

Stable publish does this:

- publishes `X.Y.Z` to npm under `latest`
- creates the local release commit
- creates the local git tag `vX.Y.Z`

Stable publish does **not** push the release for you.

## Step 7 — Push and Create GitHub Release

After stable publish succeeds:

```bash
git push origin HEAD:master --follow-tags
./scripts/create-github-release.sh X.Y.Z
```

Use the stable changelog file as the GitHub Release notes source.

## Step 8 — Finish the Other Surfaces

Create or verify follow-up work for:

- website changelog publishing
- launch post / social announcement
- any release summary in Paperclip issue context

These should reference the stable release, not the canary.

## Failure Handling

If the canary is bad:

- publish another canary, do not ship stable

If stable npm publish succeeds but push or GitHub release creation fails:

- fix the git/GitHub issue immediately from the same checkout
- do not republish the same version

If `latest` is bad after stable publish:

```bash
./scripts/rollback-latest.sh <last-good-version>
```

Then fix forward with a new patch release.

## Output

When the skill completes, provide:

- stable version and, if relevant, the final canary version tested
- verification status
- npm status
- git tag / GitHub Release status
- website / announcement follow-up status
- rollback recommendation if anything is still partially complete
